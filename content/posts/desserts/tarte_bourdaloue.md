1. For the crust: in a bowl, add the flour, almond flour, sugar, xantham gum, salt. Add the butter and almond butter, and mix with a spatula by scraping the dry ingredients with the wet until "sablé". Whisk together the linseed meal and hot water until viscous, add to the mixture and mix by hand until the dough is homogeneous. Refridgerate 30 minutes before use
2. For the almond creme: in a bowl, mix with a spatula the butter, sugar, almonds, salt. Add the apple sauce, cornstarch, rhum. Mix well and refridgerate for 30 minutes before use
3. For the pears: peel the pears. In a pot, bring water, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon to a boil. Add the pears and poach for 15-20 minutes. Drain and let the pears cool. Slice them in half length wise, remove the core, and slice them thinly width wise
4. Assembly: press the dough into a mold and prick with a fork. Spread the almond creme evenly, and arrange the pear slices. Sprinkle with sliced almonds
5. Bake for 45 minutes at 180C
6. Nappage: bring the water and sugar to a boil, and remove from the heat. When the tarte is baked, spread the nappage with a brush
