#### Ingredients

_Makes a large cake_ 

##### Batter

* Neutral oil and all-purpose flour for the pan
* 1 to 2 cups granulated sugar, to taste (200g-400g)
* 2 tbsp poppy seeds
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 3 cups all-purpose flour (390g)
* 1 1/2 cups mylk (360g)
* 1 1/3 cups neutral oil, eg. vegetable or grapeseed (288g)
* 3 flax eggs
* 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 tsp almond extract
* zest of 1 bio lemon

##### Glaze

* 3/4 cup powdered sugar (90g)
* 1/4 lemon juice (55g)
* 2 tsp vegan butter, melted
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp almond extract

#### How to

1. Preheat the oven to 175C and brush/dust the bundt pan with oil and flour
2. In a large bowl mix all dry ingredients together, then add the wet ingredients and mix well for 2 minutes
3. Pour the batter in the bundt pan and bake for 80-90 mins
4. In the mean time, mix the icing ingredients together
5. When a knife comes clean out of the cake, take it out of the oven and let it cool for 15 minutes before removing it from the bundt pan
6. Poke the cake all over with a skewer. This will help the glaze seep in and be absorbed. While cake is still warm, use a pastry brush to brush the glaze over
