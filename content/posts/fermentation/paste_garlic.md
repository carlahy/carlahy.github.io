####Â Ingredients

* garlic
* salt
* optional: ginger, bay leaves

#### How to:

1. Peel the garlic and cut off the woody end. If making a garlic-ginger or ginger paste, peel the ginger with a spoon
2. Weigh the garlic (and ginger), and add 2.5% of the weight in salt. Eg: if you have 300 grams of garlic, then add 6 grams of salt
3. Blend the garlic (and ginger) and salt using a food processor, and pour in a glass jar
4. Push the paste down so it does not have any air bubbles, and add a fermentation weight (or equivalent). Throughout the next weeks, if you notice air bubbles just push them down
5. After 2 weeks the ginger should be ready. Store in an airtight container in the fridge
