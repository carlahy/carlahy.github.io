_Makes 12 wontons_

### Ingredients

* wonton wrappers, this makes 12 but maybe more
* 1 tsp ginger, finely chopped
* 100 g tempeh, tofu, vegan meat ground, or other mock meat, finely chopped
* 3-4 pak choi leaves, finely chopped
* 2 green onions, finely chopped
* 1/2 tsp corn starch, + 1 tbsp water

#### Sauce

* 2 tbsp fragrant soy sauce
* 2 tbsp crispi chili oil
* 2-3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 3 tbsp green onions

#### Fragrant Soy Sauce

* 100 ml light soy sauce
* 200 ml water
* 1/3 cinnamon stick
* 1/2 star anise
* 1/4 tsp fennel seeds
* 1/2 tsp sichuan peppercorns
* 2 tbsp brown sugar

### How to

#### Fragrant Soy Sauce

1. In a sauce pan, bring all ingredients except sugar to a boil. Then turn down to a simmer, and simmer for 30 minutes
2. Cut the heat and add the sugar

#### Dumplings

1. Finely chop the ginger, vegan meat substitute, pak choi, green onion and combine them in a small bowl with the corn starch mixture
2. Prepare a bowl of cold water. Take a dumpling wrapper and scoop a spoon of the filling in the center. Dip a finger in the cold water and run it along the edge of half the wrapper, then fold it in half. Shape it in any way you want, such as folding in half and bringing the ends together
3. Prepare the serving bowls with the sauce: add the chili oil and  fragrant soy sauce, either all in one or divided in between the bowls
4. Bring a large pot of boiling water to a roaring boil, and add the dumplings. Stir so they don't stick together. When the water comes to a roaring boil again add a small cup of cold water, wait until it boils again and repeat. On the third boil the wontons should be ready. With a slotted spoon, remove them and put them in the serving bowl(s)
5. Top with freshly chopped garlic and more green onions
